<h2>Malignant bone tumors</h2>

<p>
    a. <b>osteosarcoma</b> - This is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone. The peak incidence is in males 10
    to 20
    years of age. The tumor occurs most frequently in the metaphysis of long bones; the proximal portion of the tibia
    and most distal portion of the femur (around the knee) are preferred sites. There are several histologic variants:
    osteoblastic tumors show prominent osteoid formation, whereas chondroblastic tumors form cartilaginous matrix and
    may have relatively scant bony differentiation. Malignant cartilage-forming bone tumors in children invariably
    represent chondroblastic osteosarcomas, rather than conventional chondrosarcomas, because the latter is virtually
    never seen in pediatric patients. The fibroblastic variant may easily be mistaken for a reactive process (and vice
    versa).
</p>

<p>
    Ewing sarcoma - This extremely anaplastic “small blue cell” malignant tumor has a morphologic resemblance to
    malignant lymphoma. It is virtually indistinguishable from primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNet) of the soft
    tissue. Although these were once thought to be distinct entities with PNET expressing more neural features than
    Ewing sarcoma, further work has shown that neural-type rosettes can also be seen in Ewing sarcoma. Both tumors most
    often demonstrate the 11;22 chromosomal translocation, which results in the fusion of the EWS1 gene to the FLI-1
    gene. Variant translocations—most often t(21;22)— are occasionally encountered.

<ol class="outline">
    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis - Pathogenic features

        <ol>
            <li> Rheumatoid arthritis is likely of autoimmune origin, with interplay of genetic and
                environmental factors.
            </li>
            <li>It is often characterized by the presence of serum rheumatoid factor, an immunoglobulin
                (most often IgM) with anti-IgG Fc specificity, which is highly characteristic of, but not specific for,
                rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is useful in diagnosis. Another, recently described
                marker is anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP), positive in 70% of early
                rheumatoid arthritis.
            </li>
            <li>It occurs most often in HLA-DR4-positive individuals.</li>
        </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Osteoarthritis - Pathogenic features
        <ol>
            <li>the most common form of arthritis. This chronic noninflammatory joint disease is
                characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage accompanied by new bone formation
                subchondrally and at the margins of the affected joint.
            </li>
            <li>It is often characterized by the presence of serum rheumatoid factor, an immunoglobulin
                (most often IgM) with anti-IgG Fc specificity, which is highly characteristic of, but not
                specific for, rheumatoid arthritis.
            </li>
            <li>useful in diagnosis
