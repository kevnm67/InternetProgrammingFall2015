<p>
    Malignant bone tumors
    a. osteosarcoma - This is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone. The peak incidence is in males 10 to 20
    years of age. The tumor occurs most frequently in the metaphysis of long bones; the proximal
    portion of the tibia and most distal portion of the femur (around the knee) are preferred sites. There are several
    histologic variants: osteoblastic tumors show prominent osteoid
    formation, whereas chondroblastic tumors form cartilaginous matrix and may have relatively scant bony
    differentiation. Malignant cartilage-forming bone tumors in children invariably represent chondroblastic
    osteosarcomas, rather than conventional chondrosarcomas, because the latter is virtually never seen in pediatric
    patients. The fibroblastic variant may easily be mistaken for a reactive process (and vice versa).
</p>

<p>
    Ewing sarcoma - This extremely anaplastic “small blue cell” malignant tumor has a morphologic resemblance to
    malignant lymphoma. It is virtually indistinguishable from primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNet) of the
    soft tissue. Although these were once thought to be distinct entities with PNET expressing more neural features than
    Ewing sarcoma, further work has shown that neural-type rosettes can also be seen in Ewing sarcoma. Both tumors most
    often demonstrate the 11;22 chromosomal translocation, which results in the fusion of the EWS1 gene to the FLI-1
    gene. Variant translocations—most often t(21;22)— are occasionally encountered.

                        <li> Rheumatoid arthritis is likely of autoimmune origin, with interplay of genetic and

                            factors.
                        <li>It is often characterized by the presence of serum rheumatoid factor, an immunoglobulin
                            (most often
                            IgM) with anti-IgG Fc specificity, which is highly characteristic of, but not specific for,
                            rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is useful in diagnosis. Another, recently described
                            marker
                            is anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP), positive in 70% of early

                            arthritis.

                            characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage accompanied by new bone formation
                            subchondrally and at the margins of the affected joint.
